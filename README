NeuralPerl is a Perl module developed for managing neural networks,
and it's basically a Perl version, almost completely compatible, of
Neural++ library for C++.

For the installation:

$ perl Makefile.PL
$ make
$ make test (optional)
# make install

For the usage, just take a look in the 'examples' directory, or,
after the installation, take a look at the documentation via
'man NeuralNet'.
